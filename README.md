# Fano Web Framework

Pascal web application framework

## Requirement

- [FreePascal](https://www.freepascal.org/) >= 3.0
- Web Server (Apache, nginx)

## Installation

Fano is standalone library and basically is not very useful on its own
because it depends on an application to bootstrap.

You may clone [Fano App](https://github.com/zamronypj/fano-app) repository as
base application skeleton.

When you clone [Fano App](https://github.com/zamronypj/fano-app) repository, it automatically pulls this repository as its submodule which then ready to be compiled and run.

Follow the instruction [Fano App](https://github.com/zamronypj/fano-app) repository for installation.
